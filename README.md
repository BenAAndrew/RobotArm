# RobotArm
Industrial 6 axis robot arm design for Makerspace development week (V1). Improvements to be made; tensioning &amp; change to brushless DC motors

Based on existing hooby projects but redesigned to simplify assembly.
Arm can be constructed with all files attached using 4x NEMA 17 & 1x NEMA 14 stepper motors.

RobotArmV1.ino & stepper_motor.h are the firmware & class files to control the arm via serial communication

Improvements needed so please contact me if you'd like to use this project and I can help you redesign it.
