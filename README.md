# RobotArm
Industrial 6 axis robot arm design for Makerspace development week (V1). Improvements to be made; tensioning &amp; change to brushless DC motors

Arm can be constructed with all files attached using 4x NEMA 17 & 1x NEMA 14 stepper motors.

Improvements needed so please contact me if you'd like to use this project and I can help you redesign it.
